                    Jordan is home to vast wildlife, the country is a very important migratory route for many bird species, the red sea is home to over 500 species of fish. Apart from the vast Jordanian wilderness, at a Seamonkey adventure, we try to maximize your chances of also spotting Arabian oryx, water buffalo, raptors, sea turtles, rock hyrax, desert foxes & Nubian ibex. There are animals that very few people have recorded in Jordan that are extremely difficult to find because of their very shy and skittish nature such as striped hyenas, sand cats, Eurasian badgers and whale sharks.
